🏥 Data Warehouse for EthioMedical
The Data Warehouse for EthioMedical project is designed to streamline healthcare data storage, reporting, and analytics for medical institutions in Ethiopia 📈. By creating a centralized data repository, this project aims to support healthcare providers in efficiently accessing patient data, managing records, and generating actionable insights. The data warehouse consolidates diverse healthcare datasets into a structured and scalable format, improving data quality, accessibility, and decision-making for medical staff and administrators.

This repository includes SQL scripts for creating and managing the data warehouse schema, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and sample reports to demonstrate the analytical capabilities of the system 💾. Tools and technologies used include SQL, Power BI for data visualization, and Python for data preprocessing and ETL tasks. With this project, EthioMedical can leverage advanced data warehousing techniques to support critical operations, enhance patient care, and enable data-driven policy making in the healthcare sector 🏥.
